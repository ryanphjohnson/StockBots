Machine Learning project focusing on stock trading. Run using "node stockbots.js train".

Retrospective Notes:
I think I went about building this project in the wrong order. I think it would've been better to start with the "core truths" of the software first instead of building the framework first. If I were to redo this, I'd start at the hardest/most interesting part first, that being the actual machine learning pieces. SpaceX builds rockets by starting with the hardest part first, and builds the rocket around it. They start with the COPV, which is a highly pressurized carbon fiber fuel tank that holds very cold LOX and helium. This is the thing thats going to expload and cause everything to fail, or require major readjustments to the project. Similarly, this project should've started at the machine learning, and build the frame around that. That way, I think there would be less framework, and more time spent perfecting the core functionality. On a larger project with more developers, this is probably a non-issue, but for a one man job, I think I'd do it differently.
